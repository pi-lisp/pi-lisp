```
(shell cmd)  →  String

```

`cmd` must be a command string. Standard error is ignored unless redirected within the command string.

---

### `shell-status`

(shell-status cmd)  →  Number

```

`cmd` must be a command string. Returns the integer exit code (or `-1.0` if the process was terminated by a signal or the exit code cannot be retrieved) represented as a float.
